# How to debug Boostnote (electron app)
The electron that makes Boostnote is made from Chromium, developers can use `Developer Tools` as same as Google Chrome.

This is how to toggle Developer Tools:

The Developer Tools is like this:

When errors occur, the error messages are displayed at the `console`.

## Debugging
I assume to put `debugger` as a breakpoint into the code is a good way to debug like this:

But this is only an example. You need to find a way to debug which fits with you.
